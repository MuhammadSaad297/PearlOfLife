        PEARLS OF MY LYFE are the things that I have cherished the most. There
        are many experiences that bring us joy and we wish to share with family.
        Things like the old neighborhood, spending time with grandparents, old
        friends, old hangout places, the way things used to be or older family
        members who instilled value in you.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are all pearls that each one of us have experienced and know carry
        with us. They should not be tossed away or forgotten upon our graduation
        into eternity.
      </p>
      <p>
        What if POML existed in the past? You could click a place in this
        website and see an old family member talking to you about the things
        they cherished the most and want to leave the memory behind for you to
        have (smile); or what if they left behind some wisdom that could keep
        you out of trouble and on a good path in life. That is how it is
        supposed to be, family passing down traditions, wisdom, knowledge and
        many other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes we don’t have the words when we are in front of loved ones.
        Some relationships are estranged and it’s hard to communicate. You still
        care about them and have value to give them. Now, you can take your
        time, think about what this life and your loved ones have meant to you;
        and leave it all in your PEARLS OF MY LYFE account.
